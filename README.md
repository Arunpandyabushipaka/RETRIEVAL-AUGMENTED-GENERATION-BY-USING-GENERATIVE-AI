# RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED-GENERATION-BY-USING-GENERATIVE-AI
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines information retrieval with generative language models (LLMs) to produce accurate, contextually relevant responses. It retrieves up-to-date information from external sources, such as databases or documents, and integrates it into the model's output, enhancing accuracy without retraining
